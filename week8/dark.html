<h1> I crave your mouth, your voice, your hair </h1> 

<p> <i> Silent and starving, I prowl through the streets. <br>
Bread does not nourish me, dawn disrupts me, all day <br>
I hunt for the liquid measure of your steps </br> </i> </p> 

<h2> I hunger for your sleek laugh, </h2>
<p2> your hands the color of a savage harvest, 
hunger for the pale stones of your fingernails, 
I want to eat your skin like a whole almond. </p2>

<h3> I want to eat the sunbeam flaring in your lovely body, </h3> 
<p3> the sovereign nose of your arrogant face, 
I want to eat the fleeting shade of your lashes, </p3> 

<h4> and I pace around hungry, sniffing the twilight, </h4> 
<p4> hunting for you, for your hot heart, 
Like a puma in the barrens of Quitratue  </p4>
